Welcome to the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Java!

This directory contains an early adopter release of the Maps SDK for Java which supports ARM Linux platforms.  

This release is for testing purposes only and should not be used in production systems.
The SDK is supplied as a Maven local installation script and this can by run with the install-local.sh script.

A GitHub branch has been set up to use this release at https://github.com/Esri/java-gradle-starter-project/tree/ArmLinuxPreview

The release has been tested against ARM versions of Ubuntu 20 and ARM64 Debian OS on a Raspberry Pi.  
For embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi the OpenGL capabilities of the device may not meet the required OpenGL 3.1 support level for displaying the MapView.  Using the API on embedded devices is best suited to headless IoT remote sensing applications.

As this is an early adopter release, please provide feedback to us about your experiences using this API.  We are also interested in the applications you are writing using this API. Weâ€™re looking forward to hearing your feedback!
